Some cool tools for STEAMID tomfoolery

incrementn.cpp - increments the AccountID cleanly in order to list all n STEAMIDs
incrementall.cpp - increments and lists STEAMIDs for all possible AccountIDs in the 32bit range

steamidsforninstances.cpp - increments the 20-bit instance sections n amount of times in order to create multiple links to a steam profile
steamidsforallinstances.cpp - increments all possible 20-bit instances for an account (I couldn't get this one to work with command line arguments because that first bitset would not accept it, if anyone has a solution please make a pull request, thank you.)
